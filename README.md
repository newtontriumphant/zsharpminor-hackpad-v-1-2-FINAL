# zsharpminor-hackpad-v-1-2-FINAL

HackPad built by zsharpminor for HackClub's Blueprint Program. Fully Modular, with 6 Cherry MX-Style Switch Ports, 1 Rotary Encoder, and 1 Mini RGB LED.

Fun Fact: This was my first time creating a serious project in KiCad! I think it turned out quite well, took some time but it was worth it! Hopefully it works :)
