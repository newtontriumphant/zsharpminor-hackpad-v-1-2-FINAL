# zsharpminor-hackpad-v-1-2-FINAL

HackPad built by zsharpminor for HackClub's Blueprint Program. Fully Modular, with 6 Cherry MX-Style Switch Ports, 1 Rotary Encoder, and 1 Mini RGB LED.

Fun Fact: This was my first time creating a serious project in KiCad! I think it turned out quite well, took some time but it was worth it! Hopefully it works :)

**UPDATE**: Gerber file added to PCB folder, BOM and CPL files added to subfolder as well (but they won't be needed as I will not be using PCBA). Thanks for your time! :)

# BOM:

* 1x PCB
* 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040 Through-Hole
* 6x Cherry MX-style Switches
* 6x Cherry MX-style Keycaps (Blank)
* 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder
* 1x SK6812 MINI-E LED
* 4x M3x16mm screws
* 4x M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts

* 1x Case to be entirely 3d-printed (self-provided), iterations may occur.

# UPDATE: CAD MODEL WITH 3D MODELED PCB AND COMPONENTS!

## No. 1: PCB in case without keycaps:

## No. 2: PCB in case with keycaps:

## No. 3: FULLY ASSEMBLED case with PCB in a mock-up of red PLA.

(Ignore the silly keycap profile, also I couldn't find an exact texture for the rotary encoder knob I have so I hope it doesn't get denied for that!)
